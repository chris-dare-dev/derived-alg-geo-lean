# Generalization backlog

Append-only. One row per altitude finding that could not be acted on inside the
chunk that found it.

This file exists because a reviewer who notices that a theorem holds in greater
generality usually notices it while reviewing a frozen chunk that may not touch
the ancestor module. Before this file existed, that observation had nowhere to
go: the reviewer could either suppress it or make it a blocking `needs_changes`
the chunk could not legally satisfy. Both outcomes lost the finding.

**Deliberately outside `openspec/changes/`.** `openspec_digest` in
`scripts/loop_engine.py` hashes only the required artifacts under a change
directory. A backlog living there would be digest-frozen, and appending to it
mid-run would invalidate every passed ledger in the run. Here it is free to grow.

## Rules

- Append only. Never delete a row; change its state in place.
- A row is cheap. Record a lift you are unsure of rather than not recording it.
- A falsified lift is a **result**, not a retraction. `abstraction-tree.md` is
  explicit that a failed unification recorded with its counterexample is a
  successful architecture outcome. Keep the row and mark it `FALSIFIED`.
- Read this file in Phase 0, before choosing an implementation approach. A row
  here may already answer where the work belongs.

## States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `UNVERIFIED` | Proposed. The general statement has not been compiled. |
| `CONFIRMED <PR>` | The lift was implemented and merged. |
| `FALSIFIED <counterexample>` | The general statement is false. Leaves stay separate. |

## Row schema

```
### <date> — <leaf declaration>
- chunk:              <chunk id>
- reviewing commit:   <sha>
- found by:           <reviewer or advisor name>
- proposed ancestor:  <module or namespace>
- weaker hypotheses:  <the binder/typeclass set the proof actually needs>
- state:              UNVERIFIED | CONFIRMED <PR> | FALSIFIED <counterexample>
```

## Rows

_None yet. The first rows will be written by the review panel in Phase 2._

# Structural cutover ledger

This ledger records known ownership defects that have been confirmed by the
signature test in `placement.md`. It is a migration queue, not an allowlist:
new code must use the canonical owner immediately, and touching one of these
blocks should normally move it rather than add more declarations beside it.

## Completed roots

- Generic moduli boundedness: `CategoryTheory/Moduli/Boundedness.lean`.
- Generic replete subprestack machinery:
  `CategoryTheory/Pseudofunctor/ObjectProperty/`, reusing Mathlib's
  `Pseudofunctor.ObjectProperty.fullsubcategory`.
- Ordinary ring/module helpers already extracted to `Algebra/Module/`.
- Generic sheaves and ringed-site module sheaves:
  `CategoryTheory/Sites/Sheaves/`.
- Generic abelian and derived-category infrastructure:
  `CategoryTheory/Abelian/` and
  `CategoryTheory/Triangulated/DerivedCategory/`.
- Ordinary semilinear and top exterior-power algebra:
  `LinearAlgebra/ExteriorPower/`.
- Exterior powers of presheaves of modules over an arbitrary ring presheaf:
  `CategoryTheory/Sites/Sheaves/Modules/ExteriorPower.lean`; scheme
  sheafification and restriction comparisons remain geometric consumers.
- Higher-categorical adjunctions: Mathlib's
  `CategoryTheory.Bicategory.Adjunction`, extended under
  `CategoryTheory/Bicategory/Adjunction/`; ordinary adjoint functors are the
  `Cat` specialization through `Adjunction.bicategoricalEquiv`.
- Generic preservation through composition and reflective transport:
  `CategoryTheory/Limits/Preserves/`. The former repository
  `CategoryTheory/Adjunction/` root is retired.
- Module-localization kernel maps:
  `Algebra/Module/Localization/Kernels.lean`. This owns `LinearMap.kerMap` and
  the `IsLocalizedModule.{kerMap,kernelMap,kernelNatTrans}` chain; the
  coherent-sheaf kernel theorem imports and directly reuses that root.
- Relative-perfect moduli selectors are explicitly fiberwise:
  `AlgebraicGeometry.RelativePerfectModuliSelector` exposes `familyLocus` and
  `geometricLocus`, each closed under isomorphisms but with no claimed
  restriction maps. The genuine affine relative-perfect subprestack is built
  separately by `AffineFamilyRelativePerfectPseudofunctor.lean` through the
  generic `universallyStable` and `fullsubcategory` APIs.
- Weighted-basis decompositions:
  `LinearAlgebra/GradedBasis.lean` owns `gradedPiece`, its spanning and
  independence results, and multiplicativity promoted from basis vectors.
  `AlgebraicGeometry/Numerical/Core/GradedBasis.lean` retains only
  `NumericalRingData.ofGradedBasis` and its smoke test.
- Division by multivariate monomials:
  `Algebra/MvPolynomial/DivMonomial.lean` owns the `Finsupp.degree` bridge,
  homogeneous-degree result, factor-commutation identities, and
  `MvPolynomial.divMonomial_pow_mul`. The projective Laurent projection imports
  that root directly.
- Graded-module localization and shifts:
  `Algebra/Module/GradedModule/` extends Mathlib's `GradedModule` namespace with
  `DegreeZeroLocalization`, natural and integer shifts, twist
  trivializations, and transport along equal power denominators. Proj sheaves
  and Čech complexes import these roots as geometric consumers.
- Laurent monomial bases:
  `Algebra/Finsupp/LaurentExponent.lean` owns the exponent-vector arithmetic,
  while `Algebra/MvPolynomial/{Grading,LaurentBasis}.lean` owns the standard
  polynomial grading, polynomial twists, and the monomial spanning and
  independence API for degree-zero localizations. The former
  `AlgebraicGeometry/Proj/Modules/LaurentBasis.lean` path is retired.
- Laurent localization projections and blocks:
  `Algebra/MvPolynomial/{LaurentProjection,LaurentBlock,LaurentHomotopy,LaurentFinite}.lean`
  owns representative-independent sign projections, negative-support block
  projections, the one-localization contracting map, and full-block
  finite-generation results. The corresponding former Proj module paths are
  retired; projective Čech assembly imports the algebraic leaves directly.

## Confirmed next lanes

1. Review the boundary beginning at
   `AlgebraicGeometry/Proj/Modules/CechHomotopy.lean`: its current signatures
   assemble the Laurent-localization maps against the polynomial variable Čech
   terms, while later consumers connect those terms to projective sheaves and
   cohomology. Separate any remaining algebraic Čech prefix before moving the
   genuinely geometric comparison layer.

For each lane, remove the old path rather than retaining an import-only shim,
update audits and umbrellas in the same pull request, and add a focused
layering guard preventing the declaration from returning to its consumer.

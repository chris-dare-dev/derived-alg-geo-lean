# Structural cutover ledger

This ledger records known ownership defects that have been confirmed by the
signature test in `placement.md`. It is a migration queue, not an allowlist:
new code must use the canonical owner immediately, and touching one of these
blocks should normally move it rather than add more declarations beside it.

## Completed roots

- Generic moduli boundedness: `CategoryTheory/Moduli/Boundedness.lean`.
- Generic replete subprestack machinery:
  `CategoryTheory/Pseudofunctor/ObjectProperty/`, reusing Mathlib's
  `Pseudofunctor.ObjectProperty.fullsubcategory`.
- Ordinary ring/module helpers already extracted to `Algebra/Module/`.
- Generic sheaves and ringed-site module sheaves:
  `CategoryTheory/Sites/Sheaves/`.
- Generic abelian and derived-category infrastructure:
  `CategoryTheory/Abelian/` and
  `CategoryTheory/Triangulated/DerivedCategory/`.
- Ordinary semilinear and top exterior-power algebra:
  `LinearAlgebra/ExteriorPower/`.
- Exterior powers of presheaves of modules over an arbitrary ring presheaf:
  `CategoryTheory/Sites/Sheaves/Modules/ExteriorPower.lean`; scheme
  sheafification and restriction comparisons remain geometric consumers.
- Higher-categorical adjunctions: Mathlib's
  `CategoryTheory.Bicategory.Adjunction`, extended under
  `CategoryTheory/Bicategory/Adjunction/`; ordinary adjoint functors are the
  `Cat` specialization through `Adjunction.bicategoricalEquiv`.
- Generic preservation through composition and reflective transport:
  `CategoryTheory/Limits/Preserves/`. The former repository
  `CategoryTheory/Adjunction/` root is retired.
- Module-localization kernel maps:
  `Algebra/Module/Localization/Kernels.lean`. This owns `LinearMap.kerMap` and
  the `IsLocalizedModule.{kerMap,kernelMap,kernelNatTrans}` chain; the
  coherent-sheaf kernel theorem imports and directly reuses that root.
- Relative-perfect moduli selectors are explicitly fiberwise:
  `AlgebraicGeometry.RelativePerfectModuliSelector` exposes `familyLocus` and
  `geometricLocus`, each closed under isomorphisms but with no claimed
  restriction maps. The genuine affine relative-perfect subprestack is built
  separately by `AffineFamilyRelativePerfectPseudofunctor.lean` through the
  generic `universallyStable` and `fullsubcategory` APIs.
- Weighted-basis decompositions:
  `LinearAlgebra/GradedBasis.lean` owns `gradedPiece`, its spanning and
  independence results, and multiplicativity promoted from basis vectors.
  `AlgebraicGeometry/Numerical/Core/GradedBasis.lean` retains only
  `NumericalRingData.ofGradedBasis` and its smoke test.
- Division by multivariate monomials:
  `Algebra/MvPolynomial/DivMonomial.lean` owns the `Finsupp.degree` bridge,
  homogeneous-degree result, factor-commutation identities, and
  `MvPolynomial.divMonomial_pow_mul`, exact division by a variable power, and
  cross-variable cancellation. Projective Laurent and section comparisons
  import that root directly.
- Graded-module localization and shifts:
  `Algebra/Module/GradedModule/` extends Mathlib's `GradedModule` namespace with
  `DegreeZeroLocalization`, natural and integer shifts, twist
  trivializations, and transport along equal power denominators. Proj sheaves
  and Čech complexes import these roots as geometric consumers.
- Laurent monomial bases:
  `Algebra/Finsupp/LaurentExponent.lean` owns the exponent-vector arithmetic,
  while `Algebra/MvPolynomial/{Grading,LaurentBasis}.lean` owns the standard
  polynomial grading, polynomial twists, and the monomial spanning and
  independence API for degree-zero localizations. The former
  `AlgebraicGeometry/Proj/Modules/LaurentBasis.lean` path is retired.
- Laurent localization projections and blocks:
  `Algebra/MvPolynomial/{LaurentProjection,LaurentBlock,LaurentHomotopy,LaurentFinite}.lean`
  owns representative-independent sign projections, negative-support block
  projections, the one-localization contracting map, and full-block
  finite-generation results. The corresponding former Proj module paths are
  retired; the polynomial Čech algebra and its geometric consumers import the
  algebraic leaves directly.
- Polynomial variable Čech algebra:
  `Algebra/MvPolynomial/Cech/{Basic,Homotopy,Primitive,Finite}.lean` owns the
  denominator diagram, graded-localization terms and faces, canonical `p / 1`
  variable-localization element, block homotopy, cocycle primitive, and
  finite-block assembly. The former
  `AlgebraicGeometry/Proj/Modules/Cech{Homotopy,Primitive,Finite}.lean` paths
  are retired. `Proj/Modules/ProjectiveSpace.lean` now begins at comparison
  with projective basic opens and sections; geometric cohomology files import
  the algebraic leaves directly.
- Polynomial projective-space algebraic prefix:
  `Algebra/MvPolynomial/Grading.lean` owns generation by the variables over the
  degree-zero homogeneous submodule; `DivMonomial.lean` owns the exact-division
  and cross-variable cancellation lemmas; and `Cech/Basic.lean` owns the
  canonical localized fraction. `Proj/Modules/ProjectiveSpace.lean` now keeps
  only the generic-point, basic-open, section, and cohomology comparisons that
  introduce geometric vocabulary.

## Confirmed next lanes

1. Extract the remaining generic arithmetic prefix of
   `AlgebraicGeometry/Cohomology/Cech/NegativeTwist.lean` after signature
   review. `intShiftPiece_eq_bot_of_neg` belongs with graded-module shifts;
   `eq_zero_of_X_pow_dvd_of_isHomogeneous_of_lt` and
   `num_eq_zero_of_cross_of_neg` use only multivariate-polynomial arithmetic and
   belong in an `Algebra/MvPolynomial/` owner. Keep only the Čech-kernel and
   projective-cohomology plumbing in the geometric consumer.

For each lane, remove the old path rather than retaining an import-only shim,
update audits and umbrellas in the same pull request, and add a focused
layering guard preventing the declaration from returning to its consumer.
